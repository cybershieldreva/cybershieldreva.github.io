//* How our project works: *//
Education is the most powerful weapon in the world. Cybershield is  a knowledge weapon that helps the people to defend themselves from falling into the track of cyber attackers.
Developing security methods for the Web is a daunting task, in part because security concerns arose after the fact. 
Today, with an internationally connected user network and rapidly expanding Web functionality, reliability and security are critical. Vendors engaged in retrofitting security must contend with the Web environment's peculiarities, 
which include location irrelevance, statelessness, code and user mobility, and stranger-to-stranger communication. The authors offer a survey of Web security issues, 
focusing on particular areas of concern, such as server security,
mobile code, data transfer, and user privacy.The trouble with the world is not that people know too little; it's that they know so many things that just aren't so.
Therefore the main moto of our website is to "Educate The Educated".
Dealing with web application or website security issues requires deep insight and planning, not only because of the many tools that are available but also because of the industry immaturity. 
Thus, finding the proper tools requires deep understanding and several steps, including analyzing the development environment, business needs, and the web applications' complexity. The speciality of our website is any one in the world can access to it and get prior knowledge , It is user  friendly where iits not neccesary for the user to check with thier login credentials.
This is also an interactive platform where they can share thier experience through commands in blogs and get useful information and instructions .
